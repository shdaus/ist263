    Hi! I am a sophomore in the iSchool. I am interested in web design and project management.
    I was a success scholar last year and learned to code in python.
    When I am not in school, I try to be outdoors as much as possible. I love snowboarding and playing pick-up games of any sport to feed my competitiveness. Right now, I am watching Peaky Blinders and itâ€™s one of my favorite shows. This summer, I traveled to Montana and spent a week hiking in glacier national park.
